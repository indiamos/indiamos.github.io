## Background

I’m a native Manhattanite and longtime Brooklyn resident. I've also lived in Sacramento and Seattle.

Yes, India is my real name! No, my parents weren’t hippies; I’m named after [my grandmother](https://twitter.com/indiamos/status/701623710692851713).

My first experience with programming was typing out game code from a computer magazine and saving it to a cassette tape so I could play it on our TRS-80. So I grew up with amber-on-black monitors, and that’s the color scheme I use on all my e-readers, whenever possible.

## Education

*[CAD]: computer-aided design

### Ancient history

I’ve never thought of myself as particularly STEM-y, but I went to a science day camp one summer as a tween, and for the next two or three summers I attended pre-engineering school through the [New York Institute of Technology](https://www.nyit.edu/), where we learned things like CAD and the rudiments of calculus. Then I went to [Stuyvesant](http://stuy.enschool.org/), a specialized public high school for math and science.

At [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/), I majored in English with a minor in Women's Studies, but I also had fun fulfilling the course distribution requirements by taking classes like The Chemistry and Physics of Cooking. Computer Science was not much of a thing there: only 10 students in my class of 539 majored in it, all of them men.

### Early self- and community education

Once I was out of school, I started teaching _myself_ things, mostly related to work I was doing or wanted to do.

I learned Web development by reading other people’s code and modifying it; doing online tutorials; RTFM; delicately questioning the developers I worked with; and reading books on database design, HTML, CSS, XML, regular expressions, ColdFusion, usability, information architecture, graphic design, typography, and more. I was a member of the Computer Books Direct club, and I partied _hard_.

### ITP

*[ITP]: Interactive Telecommunications Program

From 2008 to 2010, I attended [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp), a graduate program in arts and technology at New York University. There I took my first computer-related classes since junior high school. These included

- [Introduction to Computational Media](http://itp.nyu.edu/varwiki/Syllabus/ICM-All-F08), with Shawn Van Every (Processing, Java)
- [Programming from A to Z](http://a2z.decontextualize.com/), with Allison Parrish (Java)
- [Crafting with Data](http://www.faludi.com/teaching/crafting-with-data/), with Rob Faludi (Processing, R)
- [Understanding Networks](http://itp.nyu.edu/archive/understandingnetworks-fall2013/ "a later version of the Understanding Networks syllabus"), with Tom Igoe (Processing, PHP)
- [Mashups: Remixing the Web](http://www.webremix.org/), with Dan Aminzade (JavaScript)

I disliked the _program_ enough to leave it without clearing two incompletes so I could graduate, but I enjoyed the _programming_ parts.

### #eprdctn

From 2010 to 2015, I did a lot of e-book QA and development, which is mostly HTML and CSS glued together with XML, some finicky zip settings, and hope. This meant working with a relatively new and rapidly changing assortment of hardware, software, vendor specs, and standards, and the two [key](http://www.elizabethcastro.com/epub/ "EPUB Straight to the Point, by Liz Castro") [books](http://kindleformatting.com/book/ "Kindle Formatting, by Joshua Tallent") on the subject quickly became outdated. So e-book developers came to rely—and still do—on daily chatting via Twitter hashtag. The [#eprdctn](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eprdctn?src=hash) community made my work possible, and I give back whenever I can.

### Grace Hopper Program

In 2017, I attended the [Grace Hopper Program](https://www.gracehopper.com/), a women-only 17-week immersive software engineering school within Fullstack Academy, which teaches JavaScript, SQL, Node, Express, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, and test-driven development, as well as CS fundamentals such as algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming. After graduating in September, I stayed on for another three months as a full-time teaching fellow.

## Work experience

I've done _many_ kinds of work, including construction, cooking, typesetting, and art direction. Below, therefore, are only the most tech-relevant highlights (not including building a lot of WordPress sites for myself, other people, and companies I worked for):

### The Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY

**Digital Media Producer (2016–2017)**

As digital content producer for [MoMA.org](https://www.moma.org/), I fielded requests from departments across the organization and made whatever site modifications could be handled by a non-engineer. This meant working with several CMSes, as well as directly editing or creating Ruby-on-Rails–based views and other miscellaneous chunks of Web. I also did a lot of content cleanup, and tidied up code that had been handled by too many freelancers and interns.

MoMA’s Digital Media team adheres to agile workflow practices, so I participated in standups, retros, issue tracking (in Pivotal), and more. I documented every process I used, made an index of all the team’s documentation, created onboarding checklists, and trained two new producers, as well as members of other departments who used our tools.

And I advanced from stumbling through intro-to-git tutorials to making commits and PRs every day. Woo!

### Amplify Education, Brooklyn, NY

**Senior Content Producer, EPUBs (2014–2015)**

We licensed hundreds of e-books from publishers, and I (with the help of three direct reports, during a crunch period) tore down and rebuilt these so they would integrate cleanly with a variety of proprietary applications including a Web-based reading system, a lesson-delivery application, [educational games](https://www.amplify.com/games/ela), and a publishing tool that was, sprint by sprint, tweaked to my specifications.

I wrote documentation for every part of the process and trained the rest of the content production team in using the publishing system. I also performed some of the more complex conversions (e.g., a set of bilingual magazines) myself.

This was my first experience working with agile software teams. Although I wasn't technically on such a team, I wrote or resolved a lot of Jira tickets (including ones on issues not at all EPUB–related—e.g., audio encoding), participated in a lot of troubleshooting conversations, and worked closely with the developers and product owners of the applications I lived in.

### F+W Media, New York, NY

**Digital Production ePub QA Associate (2011–2012)**  
**eBook Developer (2012–2014)**

For three years, under two job titles, I cleaned up e-books converted by overseas vendors, and built some of the tricksier books from scratch. Eventually I cowrote a set of guidelines and QA checklists to help conversions get done better in the first place, and I started an internal blog to help educate colleagues from across the company about the processes and constraints involved in print-to-digital conversion.

F+W publishes a lot of heavily illustrated and highly formatted books, so this job was a nonstop carnival of problem-solving and extremely non-automated testing, plus documentation of bizarre and exciting rendering issues. All with no version control system except manually time-stamped file names…

### The Academy of American Poets, New York, NY

**Webmaster (1999–2001)**

*[MS IIS]: Microsoft Internet Information Services

At one of my very first office jobs, I ended up managing [Poets.org](http://www.poets.org/), which at the time was (and surely still is) one of the largest poetry sites on the Web. I had never even _seen_ the Web before working there, but I learned to deal with the whole stack—including MS IIS, MS SQL Server, and a lot of ColdFusion—mostly by reading O'Reilly books and whatever documentation existed, in those dark days before StackOverflow. I also handled SEO and traffic analytics, wrote all of the site’s FAQ pages, and fielded dozens of e-mails a day from users. I eventually had three direct reports, all of whom also learned HTML under my guidance.

## Skills overview

I've picked up a lot of coding-related skills and experience in my career, and I’m in the habit of learning new things constantly and documenting what I learn so that others can benefit. I have longstanding interests in accessibility and in writing clean, maintainable code; I love linters; and I'm eager to learn more about automated testing. I've provided technical training to many of my colleagues, and people have told me they appreciate my patient and nonjudgmental instruction. I even made one self-avowed “friend for life” through one of my more expressive Jira tickets.

Skills are fungible, and I'm confident that I can learn whatever I need to, when I need to. But for a breakdown of what tools and practices I am familiar with _as of this moment_, [please consult this résumé Gist](https://gist.github.com/indiamos/351b64b955ae69ce777bbca809c157ee#skills--tools-used).


## Extracurriculars

Besides learning everything I can about how to make great Web applications, my pastimes include reading, walking around the city, having opinions about food, baking cakes, [photographing my cats](https://www.flickr.com/photos/iamos/), slinging bon mots on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/indiamos/with_replies), and herding GIFs.
