## Background

I’m a native Manhattanite and longtime Brooklyn resident. No, my parents weren’t hippies; “India” was my grandmother’s name.

My dad, a lapsed engineer and lifelong electronics enthusiast, built our household’s first computer, which played the theme song to [Masterpiece Theater](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/). My first experience with code was typing in games from computer magazines and saving them on cassette tapes so I could play them later.

Yes, we had many amber-on-black monitors.

## Education

*[CAD]: computer-aided design

### Prehistory

I attended pre-engineering summer school through the [New York Institute of Technology](https://www.nyit.edu/), where we learned things like CAD and the rudiments of calculus, and then [Stuyvesant High School](http://stuy.enschool.org/), a specialized public school for math and science. I enjoyed physics and chemistry but preferred working with languages, so at [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/), I majored in English with a minor in Women's Studies.

### Self- and community education

Once out of school, I continued teaching myself things, mostly related to work I was doing or wanted to do.

I learned Web development by reading other people’s code and modifying it; doing online tutorials; RTFM; delicately questioning the developers I worked with; and reading books on database design, HTML, CSS, XML, regular expressions, ColdFusion, usability, information architecture, graphic design, typography, and other topics.

(I was a member of the Computer Books Direct club, and I partied _hard_.)

### ITP

*[ITP]: Interactive Telecommunications Program

From 2008 to 2010, I attended [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp), a graduate program in arts and technology at New York University. There I had my first computer-related classes since junior high. These included

- [Introduction to Computational Media](http://itp.nyu.edu/varwiki/Syllabus/ICM-All-F08), with Shawn Van Every (Processing, Java)
- [Programming from A to Z](http://a2z.decontextualize.com/), with Allison Parrish (Java)
- [Crafting with Data](http://www.faludi.com/teaching/crafting-with-data/), with Rob Faludi (Processing, R)
- [Understanding Networks](http://itp.nyu.edu/archive/understandingnetworks-fall2013/ "a later version of the Understanding Networks syllabus"), with Tom Igoe (Processing, PHP)
- [Mashups: Remixing the Web](http://www.webremix.org/), with Dan Aminzade (JavaScript; incomplete)

I hated the program, but I enjoyed the programming.

### #eprdctn

From 2010 to 2015, I did a lot of e-book QA and development, which is mostly HTML and CSS, glued together with XML, some finicky zip settings, and hope. This meant working with a relatively new and rapidly changing assortment of hardware, software, vendor specs, and standards, and the two [key](http://www.elizabethcastro.com/epub/ "EPUB Straight to the Point, by Liz Castro") [books](http://kindleformatting.com/book/ "Kindle Formatting, by Joshua Tallent") on the subject quickly became outdated. So the developer community came to rely—and still does—on heavy communication via Twitter hashtag. The [#eprdctn](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eprdctn?src=hash) community made my work possible, and I gave back whenever I could.

### Grace Hopper Program

In 2017, I attended Fullstack Academy’s [Grace Hopper Program](https://www.gracehopper.com/), a 17-week immersive software engineering program for women that teaches JavaScript, Node, Express, React, SQL, HTML, CSS, and test-driven development, as well as CS fundamentals such as algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming. After graduating in September, I stayed on for another three months as a full-time teaching fellow. 

## Work experience

I've done a lot of kinds of work, including construction and cooking. Here are the most tech-relevant highlights, not including building a lot of WordPress sites for myself, other people, and companies I worked for:

### The Academy of American Poets, New York, NY

**Webmaster (1999–2001)**

*[MS IIS]: Microsoft Internet Information Services

At one of my very first office jobs, I ended up managing a large website, [Poets.org](http://www.poets.org/), which at the time was (and surely still is) one of the largest poetry sites on the Web. I had never seen the Web before working there, and I learned to work with the whole stack (including MS IIS, MS SQL Server, and a lot of ColdFusion pages)—mostly from O'Reilly books and reading the documentation. I had three direct reports, all of whom also learned on the job.

### F+W Media, New York, NY

**Digital Production ePub QA Associate (2011–2012)**  
**eBook Developer (2012–2014)**

For three years I tore down and rebuilt e-books converted by overseas vendors, and occasionally built books from scratch. Eventually I cowrote a set of guidelines and QA checklists to help those conversions get done better in the first place, and I started an internal blog to help colleagues from across the company understand the processes and constraints that were involved. This job was a nonstop carnival of problem-solving and manual testing, plus a lot of documentation of bizarre rendering issues. With no version control system besides manually time-stamped file names.

### Amplify Education, Brooklyn, NY

**Senior Content Producer, EPUBs (2014–2015)**

I started out doing very similar work to what I’d done at F+W, but with a proprietary Web-based reading system, a very limited list of supported hardware, and a publishing tool that was eventually built somewhat to my specifications. The company licensed hundreds of books from multiple publishers, and I—with, during a crunch period, three direct reports—scrubbed these clean so that various applications could use them. Later I trained the rest of the content production team in using our publishing tools, and I did some of the more complex conversions myself. And I wrote documentation for every process I touched.

This was my first experience working with agile software teams. Though I wasn't on such a team, I wrote and participated in discussions on a lot of Jira tickets, and I worked closely with the developers and product owners of our book-related applications.

### The Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY

**Digital Media Producer (2016–2017)**

For a little over a year, I was a digital content producer for [MoMA.org](https://www.moma.org/) making all changes that could be handled by a non-engineer, whether through one of several CMSes or by directly editing Ruby on Rails–based pages or other miscellaneous chunks of code. MoMA, too, uses an agile worflow, and I participated in the standups, retros, and so on. Again, I documented every process I touched, created onboarding checklists, and trained two new hires. And I advanced from stumbling through intro-to-git tutorials to making commits and PRs every day.

## Summary of skills

I've picked up a lot of coding-related skills and experience in my career, and I’m in the habit of learning new things constantly. I documenting whatever I do so that others can benefit. I have longstanding interests in accessibility and in writing clean, maintainable code, I love linters, and I'm excited to learn more about automated testing. I've given technical training to many of my colleagues, and some have told me they appreciate my patient and nonjudgmental help. People have actually enjoyed reading my Jira tickets.

Skills are fungible, and I'm confident that I can learn pretty much whatever I need to, whenever I need to. At present, however, I am capable in the following, to various and ever-changing degrees:
