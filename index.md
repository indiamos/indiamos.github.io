Hi, I’m India!

*[ITP]: Interactive Telecommunications Program
*[EPUB]: the distribution and interchange format standard for digital publications and documents

I’ve worked on websites since 1996, and in 2008 I enrolled in [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) at New York University. In 2010, I began teaching myself EPUB development, and for almost four years I [coded full-time](/projects/e-books.html), for book publishers and in EdTech.

I’ve picked up a wide variety of skills in the course of my career, but I always
especially loved the coding parts of my work. So in 2017, I attended the Grace
Hopper Program, an intensive full-stack JavaScript school for women. Then I
worked there for three months as a teaching fellow, helping the next cohort
master the material.

In spring 2018, I joined [Stride](https://www.stridenyc.com/) as a Consulting
Software Developer. Through Stride, I work on development teams at different
clients around NYC, learning a new stack and codebase every few months, and both
using and teaching practices such as test-driven design and pair programming.
