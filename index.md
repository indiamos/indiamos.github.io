Hi, I’m India!

*[ITP]: Interactive Telecommunications Program
*[EPUB]: the distribution and interchange format standard for digital publications and documents

I’ve worked on websites since 1996, and in 2008 I enrolled in [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) at New York University. In 2010, I began teaching myself EPUB development, and for almost four years I [coded full-time](/projects/e-books.html), for book publishers and in edtech.

In 2017, I attended the Grace Hopper Program, an intensive JavaScript school for women, at Fullstack Academy. Then I worked there for three months as a teaching fellow, helping the next cohort master the material.

Now I’m looking for a full-stack engineering position where I can apply my diverse set of skills while mastering new ones.
