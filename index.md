Hi, I’m India!

*[ITP]: Interactive Telecommunications Program
*[EPUB]: the distribution and interchange format standard for digital publications and documents

I’ve worked on websites since 1996, though I didn’t get any formal education in programming until 2008, when I enrolled in [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) at New York University.

In 2010, I began teaching myself EPUB development, and for almost four years I coded full-time, for book publishers and in edtech.

In 2017, I attended the Grace Hopper Program, an intensive JavaScript school for women, at Fullstack Academy. Then I worked there for three months as a teaching fellow, helping the next cohort master the material.

Now I’m looking for a full-stack engineering position where I can apply my diverse set of skills while mastering new ones.
