        <p>Hi, I’m India!</p>

        <p>In September 2017 I graduated from the Grace Hopper Program, an immersive full-stack JavaScript bootcamp. Then I worked there until December as a teaching fellow, helping the next cohort find their way through the material.</p>

        <p>Before that, I worked mostly at nonprofits and in publishing, including several years as an e-book developer. I've experienced the agile software development process while working at an edtech company and as part of a major museum’s Web team.</p>

        <p>Now I’m looking for a software engineering position where I can apply my diverse set of skills while mastering new ones. <a href="about.html">Learn more</a>, or <a href="contact.html">get in touch!</a></p>
