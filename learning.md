*[TDD]: test-driven development, or, sometimes “test-driven design”

One problem with résumés is that they put all the focus on what you’ve _done_,
while there's almost never room to represent what you’re _learning_ to do. And
I'm in the process of learning quite a few things — so many that I've amassed a
spreadsheet of more than 600 study resources and have been sporadically working
on an application to enable organizing, tracking progress on, and sharing them.

In the meantime, the following are some of my current areas of inquiry:

-   **GraphQL**  
    I’ve worked with GraphQL on a consulting engagement, but it wasn’t 
    _really_ necessary for what we were doing, so I only got to scratch the
    surface. I’ll be filling in some of those gaps on my next assignment.
-   **Node**  
    Because I went to a full-stack JavaScript school, and I work in JS all day,
    I have a tendency to take Node for granted. It’s just the water we swim in,
    right? What’s to know?! That attitude is all fine and nice
    until you’re trying to swim from A to B, and _the water crashes._ So lately
    I’ve been investing more time into understanding what Node _really_ is, what
    it’s capable of, and how to make the most effective use of it.
-   **Object-oriented design**  
    When I learned this approach in grad school,
    using Processing, we used code mostly to _literally_ describe objects — e.g., to draw graphics and move them around on the screen. OOP never made much sense to me in non-graphical applications, until Stride arranged to have [Sandi Metz](https://www.sandimetz.com/) teach a three-day workshop about it, which I was lucky enough to attend. The workshop was excellent, but one can only absorb so much in three days, so I’m continuing this line of study on my own.
-   **Python**  
    I've been studying Python on and off for several years, so I have a ton of –
    too many, really — resources for learning. So right now I'm focusing on
    completing _just one_. My favorite du jour is Reuven M. Lerner’s
    book-in-progress, [_Python Workout_](https://www.manning.com/books/python-workout).
-   **Refactoring**  
    In her OOP workshop, Sandi referred several times to Martin Fowler and Kent
    Beck’s book [_Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html),
    and I realized that there was a lot more to refactoring than I’d ever
    realized. So I’ve begun working my way slowly through that book.
-   **Testing**  
    I’d never really used TDD until I learned it to complete Stride's take-home
    coding challenge, when I applied to work there. As soon as I got the hang
    of this practice, though, I wished I’d picked it up much sooner. Then, on
    my first consulting engagement, I got to test-drive code almost every day,
    so I grew reasonably competent at writing unit tests, especially in the
    context of React. On my second assignment, I started getting my head around
    integration tests, but those and E2E tests are still mysterious and a bit
    terrifying, so I’m digging into them more.
-   **TypeScript**  
    I’ve used TypeScript on the job, but not enough to do much more than swear
    at it. I suspect I’ll never learn to _love_ this language, but I’ve heard
    that it at least grows less infuriating after a few months…

Once I feel I've absorbed enough of the topics above, I might dig into the following:

-   **Calculus**  
    I learned some basic calculus at pre-engineering summer camp but never took
    the class in high school, because there was a 50 percent chance of getting
    a notoriously abusive teacher, and I didn't like those odds. But I think it
    might be fun to study now?
-   **D3**  
    There are certainly other data visualization tools I'm interested in
    (Victory, for one), but this seems to be the most widely used, right now.
-   **Functional programming**  
    This is my default approach when writing JavaScript, since OOP is still
    pretty weird to me, and I attended a
    [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) event in 2016, but the word
    “functional” doesn't light up a lot of neurons in my brain. So clearly I
    need to spend more time understanding what it means in other contexts.
-   **Java**  
    I used Java in grad school but haven't really touched it since. I don't
    expect to ever _enjoy_ reading or writing Java, but it's ubiquitous and,
    apparently, inescapable.
-   **R**  
    R is yet another language I was introduced to in grad school but haven't had
    occasion to use since then.
-   **Ruby**  
    I've used RoR on the job, taken a couple of very brief classes on both Ruby
    and Rails, and muddled through enough to build this site using Jekyll, but
    I couldn't whiteboard FizzBuzz in Ruby right now for a million dollars.
-   **VueJS**  
    Some developers I know seem to looooooooove it.
-   **Everything!**  
    I know, this is a problem. I look forward to having a job so I can focus on
    whatever we're actually _using_.
