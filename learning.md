One problem with résumés is that they put all the focus on what you’ve _done_, while there's almost never room to represent what you’re _learning_ to do. And I'm in the process of learning quite a few things — so many that I've amassed a spreadsheet of more than 600 study resources and have started building an application to enable organizing, tracking progress on, and sharing them:

In the meantime, the following are some of my current areas of inquiry:

-   **Amazon Web Services**<br />I’ve used a couple of these services on the job, but I certainly don't _know_ AWS. So I'm taking a prep course for the [AWS Certified Developer – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) exam, to get an overview.
-   **Mobile development**<br />I was one of 10,000 students selected for the first phase of the [Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship: Mobile Web](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google). I hope to continue with the [Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024).
-   **Python 3**<br />I've been studying Python on and off for several years, so I have a ton of — too many, really — resources for learning. So right now I'm focusing on completing _just one_ online course.
-   **React Native**<br />We hear over and over that one of the key benefits of learning React is that one can then build mobile apps in React Native. I’ve just never actually tried it.
-   **Server-side rendering with React**<br />We spent a lot of time with React at Grace Hopper but never used server-side rendering.
-   **Testing**<br />I can _read_ tests, because we used them constantly at Grace Hopper, and I'd also encountered them on Flatiron School's Learn.co platform. But I don't feel sufficently well versed in the whens and hows of _writing_ them.

Once I feel I've absorbed enough of the topics above, I look forward to digging into the following:

-   **Calculus**<br />I learned some basic calculus at pre-engineering summer camp but never took the class in high school, because there was a 50 percent chance of getting a notoriously abusive teacher, and I didn't like those odds. But I think it might be fun to study now?
-   **D3**<br />There are certainly other data visualization tools I'm interested in (Victory, for one), but this seems to be the most widely used, right now.
-   **Functional programming**<br />We heard about this a lot at Grace Hopper, and I attended a [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) event in 2016, but the word “functional” still doesn't light up a lot of neurons in my brain.
-   **GraphQL**<br />Because nobody will shut up about it.
-   **Java 8**<br />I used Java in grad school but haven't really touched it since, and nine years is a lifetime in tech, so I'm' starting over with an online class. I don't expect to ever _like_ Java, but it's being used at a lot more non-boring companies than I ever would have expected.
-   **Object-oriented programming**<br />We learned about this in grad school, but I don't feel like I really know what it means anymore — especially as compared with functional programming.
-   **R**<br />Yet another language I was introduced to in grad school but haven't had occasion to use since then.
-   **Ruby on Rails**<br />I've used RoR on the job, taken one-day classes on Ruby and Rails, and I muddled through enough to build this site using Jekyll, but I couldn't whiteboard FizzBuzz in Ruby right now for a million dollars.
-   **VueJS**<br />Some developers I know seem to looooooooove it.
-   **Everything!**<br />I know, this is a problem. I look forward to having a job so I can focus on whatever we're actually _using_.
