I have probably hundreds of old blog posts littering up the Internet, some of the more technical selections from which are listed below. The [Medium](https://medium.com/@indiamos) blog I started while attending Grace Hopper is the freshest source, though I also still cross-post to [my self-hosted publishing blog](http://ink.indiamos.com/), because Never Trust a Free Platform.

I've also written a lot of internal documentation, most of which is locked down within the companies I wrote it for. Still retrievable, however, are all the public-facing FAQs I wrote for [Poets.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20011006043241/http://www.poets.org:80/help/index.cfm) between 1999 and 2001.

## India, Ink.

There are several of technical though non-programming blog posts (e.g., UX-related) on my old book publishing blog. See, for example,

## Digital Book World

These two articles were published on F+W Media’s Digital Book World blog (though they were also cross-posted to my own). They were meant to begin an eight-part series, but then I started working at F+W and promptly became too busy to continue.

* [E-Reading Application Showdown, Part 1: Annotations](https://web.archive.org/web/20121027084741/http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2011/e-reading-application-showdown-part-1-annotations/) (June 6, 2011)
* [E-Reading Application Showdown, Part 2: Typography](https://web.archive.org/web/20121027084936/https://www.digitalbookworld.com/2011/e-reading-application-showdown-part-2-typography) (July 28, 2011)

They have been cited in the class reader for [PUB310: Publishing in the Digital Environment](https://pub310.pressbooks.com/chapter/2-2-ebooks-e-reading-devices-formats-and-platforms/), by Kosie Eloff, Liam Borgstrom, and Laetitia Cassells (Pretoria, South Africa: University of Pretoria, 2013).
