I have a bunch of old blog posts lying around on the Internet, selections from which are listed below. The [Medium](https://medium.com/@indiamos) blog I started while attending Grace Hopper is the freshest.

I've also written a lot of internal documentation, most of which is locked down to the companies I wrote it for. Still retrievable, however, are all the public-facing FAQs I wrote for [Poets.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20011006043241/http://www.poets.org:80/help/index.cfm) between 1999 and 2001.
