My very first tech talk was at a conference in the Netherlands — a _poetry_ conference — where I was invited to explain how the website I managed, [Poets.org](https://www.poets.org/), was developed and maintained. Alas, no recording exists.

Since then, I've had several more speaking opportunities, and people have said they find my presentations informative and amusing — enough so that one of the recordings below has been used in a class.

## Be a Better Developer: Build for Accessibility (Grace Hopper Program, New York, NY, 2017)

A 10-minute tech talk presented to my Grace Hopper class.

Accessibility was not addressed in our curriculum, so I wanted to make sure everyone was at least aware of the concept. So it’s not as tech-y as some of the other talks, but one of my classmates who had already worked in tech for some time told me she’d never known about the issues I raised and now wants to make all her applications fully accessible. So: Mission Accomplished!

## Debate: Does ebook design matter? (ebookcraft, Tech Forum, Toronto, ON, 2016)

**Copresenter:** Nick Barreto. **Moderator:** Derrick Schultz.

Ebookcraft is a two-day conference dedicated to e-book production, held in Toronto; it is part of Tech Forum, an annual conference that focuses on digital developments in the book publishing industry.

This debate took place before a room full of e-book developers and served as a sort of comedy routine after all the technical workshops and talks. [Kathy Sandler](https://twitter.com/ksandler1) told me she makes students watch this video in her class E-Books: Technology, Workflow, and Business Model (Master’s in Publishing program, Pace University, NYC).

## Making Beautiful Books (Data Conversion Laboratory Learning Series, 2014)

**Copresenter:** Allan Lieberman.

A webinar on print book production and design for independent publishers. My recommendations for that process are always informed by the inevitability of conversion to one or more digital formats.

## Ebook Production: Covering All the Bases (Digital Book World Conference + Expo, New York, NY, 2013)

Copresenters: Colleen Cunningham, Iris Amelia Febres, Naomi Kennedy. Moderator: Joshua Tallent.

I talked about e-book quality assurance as part of a workshop intended to “walk you through the essential questions, processes, and information you need when developing and perfecting your eBook workflows and production plans.” The event was standing-room-only, despite its taking place at a multitrack conference.

## “PAPER SMELLS NICE I READ IT IN THE TUB” (ITP, New York University, New York, NY, 2010)

My ITP thesis presentation.

After this talk, [Red Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Burns), the director of ITP, asked if I’d be willing to come back and speak to her Applications class on the subject. This never happened, perhaps because I left the program without finishing, but it was an honor to be asked…

## Presentation on Poets.org (32nd Poetry International Festival, Rotterdam, 2001)

I was invited to speak about the process and challenges of building and managing [Poets.org](https://www.poets.org/). I think it was an hourlong presentation, and I had never given a talk before. Those poor, poor patient people.

I was also there to represent the Academy of American Poets, as one of 14 organizations from as many countries, in helping to plan the site [poetryinternationalweb.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20070517111140/http://international.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_name=www).
