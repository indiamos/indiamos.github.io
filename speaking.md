My very first tech talk was at a conference in the Netherlands—a _poetry_ conference, where I was invited to explain how the website I managed, [Poets.org](https://www.poets.org/), was developed and maintained. Alas, no recording exists.

Since then, I've had several more speaking opportunities, and people have said they find my presentations informative and amusing—enough so that at least one of the recordings below has been required for a class.

Some highlights are as follows:

## Be a Better Developer: Build for Accessibility (Grace Hopper Program, New York, NY, 2017)

**Copresenter:** Nick Barreto. **Moderator:** Derrick Schultz.

Ebookcraft is a two-day conference dedicated to ebook production, and part of Tech Forum, an annual conference that focuses on digital developments in the book publishing industry.

This debate took place before a room full of e-book developers and served as a sort of comedy routine after all the technical workshops and talks.

## Presentation on Poets.org (32nd Poetry International Festival, Rotterdam, 2001)
