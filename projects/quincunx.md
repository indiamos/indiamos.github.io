An assignment for Rob Faludi's class [Crafting with Data](https://www.faludi.com/teaching/crafting-with-data/syllabus-crafting-with-data/):

> Get to know the normal distribution intimately by building your own quincunx or Galton box. You may use either physical materials or create an imaginative software simulation.

I opted to make a software simulation. It distributes 3,000 beans and both tallies the results and draws them as an upside-down bar chart:

(This video was made in 2017, but the code is mostly unchanged from 2009, except to make it fit better on the screen.)
