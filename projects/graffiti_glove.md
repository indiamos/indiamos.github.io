A glove that uses flex sensors and a camera-tracked LED to control a drawing application.

Final project for [Intro to Physical Computing](https://web.archive.org/web/20081224055650/http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Fall08/Kate) with Kate Hartman.

I sewed the final glove and embroidered two versions of the circuit. Conductive thread tends to sprout a lot of fuzz, especially the more you handle it, so I threaded glass beads onto it to insulate the “wires” and keep it from constantly shorting.

I’m sure I also did some of the coding, but there’s no GitHub repo, and I don’t recall specifics.
