A tool for visualizing and digging into vocabulary differences between books, tinkered with over the course of two semesters.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/indiamos/albums/72157667856834299" title="Bookalator"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3310/3482314469_b1af2d9c18_z.jpg?zz&#x3D;1" width="640" height="350" alt="Bookalator"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The .swf from which the screenshots above were generated still [_exists_](/assets/BookGrid.swf "BookGrid.swf, 312 KB"), but good luck getting it to render properly on any modern-day Flash player.

A later iteration of the project, integrating the book comparisons with something like [Wordhopper](/projects/wordhopper.html), via the [Wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com/) and [Google Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/) APIs, has sadly been lost to bitrot. It is this version—whose data was crunched offline in Java and then displayed on the Web using PHP—that I am re-creating now as [BookalatorJS](/projects/bookalator_js.html).
